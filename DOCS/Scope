Scope

We want to develop a website  that will help organize and provide information on study groups
 or tutoring sessions going on in real time (within a couple of days).  Students will be able to
 navigate to a website where they will be able to search for a specific class to see if there are any 
“study groups” or “tutoring sessions” going on that day or in the near future.  For example,
 Brandon has a big exam in CIS411 that he needs to study for.  He has missed a couple of in-
class notes and would like to meet with someone or a group in order to properly prepare for the 
exam.  Brandon decided to log into StudyCards.com and search for his class, CIS411.  Some 
students have decided to study in a group and posted the meeting on StudyCards.com.  The study 
group organizer has invited other students to join in the library at 5:00PM Monday.  Brandon 
posts that he will be attending the study session and later in the day, meets the group to study for 
the CIS411 Exam.
